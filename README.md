# rock-paper-scissors

## Project Goals
* Implement a simple rock paper scissors game.

## Phase 1: Create game in browser console
Creating the game in the browser console allowed me to focus on practicing using JavaScript and implement the game's rules and logic.


## Phase 2: Create a simple GUI
The GUI was implemented using DOM manipulation. Using the logic from phase 1, I was able to concentrate on creating buttons that behaved as intended using event listeners.

## Phase 3: Stylized the UI
Make the interface look pretty using CSS!

# Reflection
This project allowed me to build on my previous experience with HTML and CSS and create a functioning web application with my new knowledge of JavaScript and DOM Manipulation. Taking this project in multiple phases helped me focus on each individual step to ensure that parts work as intended before advancing. This made the while process much easier as I didn't have to go back and keep rewriting code had I just kept moving forward with the project.

## Misc
